# The xtd libraries hierarchy

[![libraries_img](pictures/hierarchy.png)](architecture.md)


# xtd is composed of several libraries

These libraries are grouped by package :

### system

[![core](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd/blob/master/docs/pictures/xtd.core.png)](https://codedocs.xyz/gammasoft71/xtd/group__xtd__core.html)
The [xtd.core](https://codedocs.xyz/gammasoft71/xtd/group__xtd__core.html) library is modern C++17/20 libraries of classes, interfaces, and value types that provide access to system functionality. It is the foundation on which c++ applications, components, and controls are built.

### drawing

[![drawing](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd/blob/master/docs/pictures/xtd.drawing.png)](https://codedocs.xyz/gammasoft71/xtd/group__xtd__drawing.html)
The [xtd.drawing](https://codedocs.xyz/gammasoft71/xtd/group__xtd__drawing.html) library contains types that support basic GDI+ graphics functionality. Child namespaces support advanced two-dimensional and vector graphics functionality, advanced imaging functionality, and print-related and typographical services. A child namespace also contains types that extend design-time user-interface logic and drawing.

### forms

[![forms](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd/blob/master/docs/pictures/xtd.forms.png)](https://codedocs.xyz/gammasoft71/xtd/group__xtd__forms.html)
The [xtd.forms](https://codedocs.xyz/gammasoft71/xtd/group__xtd__forms.html) library contains classes for creating Windows-based applications that take full advantage of the rich user interface features available in the Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS and linux base operating system.

### tunit

[![tunit](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd/blob/master/docs/pictures/xtd.tunit.png)](https://codedocs.xyz/gammasoft71/xtd/group__xtd__tunit.html)
The [xtd.tunit](https://codedocs.xyz/gammasoft71/xtd/group__xtd__tunit.html) library is a unit-testing framework for modern C++17/20. Initially ported from [Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.Cpp](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/microsoft-visualstudio-testtools-cppunittestframework-api-reference).
