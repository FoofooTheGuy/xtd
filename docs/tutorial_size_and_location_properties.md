## Overview

There are different size and locatiion properties for an xtd::forms::control. They are related to each other.

Here is the list of these different sizes and locations :

* **bottom** : defines the distance, in pixels, between the bottom edge of the control and the top edge of its container's client area.
* **bounds** : defines the size and location of the control including its nonclient elements, in pixels, relative to the parent control.
* **client_rectangle** : defines the rectangle that represents the client area of the control.
* **client_size** : defines the height and width of the client area of the control. The client area of a control is the bounds of the control, minus the nonclient elements such as scroll bars, borders, title bars, and menus.
* **default_size** : defines the default size of the control.
* **display_rectangle** : defines the rectangle that represents the display area of the control.
* **height** : defines the height of the control.
* **left** : defines the distance, in pixels, between the left edge of the control and the left edge of its container's client area.
* **location** : defines the coordinates of the upper-left corner of the control relative to the upper-left corner of its container.
* **maximum_size** : defines the size that is the upper limit that xtd::forms::control::get_preferred_size can specify.
* **minimum_size** : defines the size that is the lower limit that xtd::forms::control::get_preferred_size can specify.
* **right** : defines the distance, in pixels, between the right edge of the control and the left edge of its container's client area.
* **size** : defines the height and width of the control.
* **top** : defines the distance, in pixels, between the top edge of the control and the top edge of its container's client area.
* **width** : defines the width of the control.
