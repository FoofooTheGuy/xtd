# Controls management

Objects that inherit xtd::forms::control are not copyable.

No object of the xtd.forms library manages controls for you. 

You are responsible for their creation and destruction. The objects of the xtd.forms library only contain references to controls.

## Remarks

Because of the events, the controls cannot be copied.

Imagine a control that responds to a click event like this:

```c++
#include <xtd/xtd>

class my_control : public xtd::forms::control {
public:
  my_control() {
    click += {*this, &my_control::on_control_click};
  }

  void on_control_click(xtd::object& sender, const xtd::event_args& e) {
    (*internal_counter)++;
  }
  private:
    std::shared_ptr<int> internal_counter = std::make_shared<int>(0);
};

int main () {
  my_control my_control1;
  
  xtd::forms::form main_form;
  main_form.controls().push_back(my_control1);
  
  xtd::forms::application::run(main_form);
}
```

If you could copy my_control1 to my_control2 like this:

```c++
#include <xtd/xtd>

class my_control : public xtd::forms::control {
public:
  my_control() {
    click += {*this, &my_control::on_control_click};
  }

  my_control(const my_control&) = default;
  my_control& operator=(const my_control&) = default;
    
  void on_control_click(xtd::object& sender, const xtd::event_args& e) {
    (*internal_counter)++;
  }
  private:
    std::shared_ptr<int> internal_counter = std::make_shared<int>(0);
};

int main () {
  my_control my_control1;
  my_control my_control2 = my_control1;
  
  xtd::forms::form main_form;
  main_form.controls().push_back(my_control1);
  
  xtd::forms::application::run(main_form);
}
```

What would happen when you go to click on the control?

my_control1::on_control_click would be called and my_control2::on_control_click would not be called. It seems to work.
Yes, but if you delete my_control1 after making the assignment to my_control2. No object will be called when you click.

So in this case it would be enough to say that in the copy constructor, the click event should also be implemented like this:

```c++
  my_control(const my_control& other) {
    *this = other;
    click += {*this, &my_control::on_control_click};    
  }

  my_control& operator=(const my_control&) {
    *this = other;
    click += {*this, &my_control::on_control_click};
    return *this;    
  }
```

So my_control2::on_control_click would be called too. But in this case, internal_counter would be incremented by 2.
And this is not what we wanted.

Ok, so let's only use the click event on my_control2 and not on my_control1. That will solve everything. Well NO, because if we delete my_control2 and we decide to keep my_control1.
No more events will be called.

So to conclude. not knowing what the user of the library will want to do. 
The controls can NEVER be copied. And to be more precise a class that contains an event can NEVER be copied.

## parent - child

When you create a label and add it to the main window as in the example below :

```c++
#include <xtd/xtd>

int main() {
  xtd::forms::label my_label;
  my_label.text("Hello, World!");

  xtd::forms::form main_form;
  main_form.controls().push_back(my_label);
  
  xtd::forms::application::run(main_form);
}
```

You must keep the instance my_label a live until the main_form is alive.

Indeed, my_label will be destroyed after main_form when the main function is finished.

### The following code is wrong :

```c++
#include <xtd/xtd>

void add_label(xtd::forms::form& f) {
  xtd::forms::label my_label;
  my_label.text("Hello, World!");

  f.controls().push_back(my_label);
}

int main() {
  xtd::forms::form main_form;
  add_label(main_form);
  
  xtd::forms::application::run(main_form);
}
```

Indeed, you create my_label in the add_label method and when the method ends, my_label is deleted. But my_form contains a reference to the child control my_label.
So the main_form will try to handle a deleted child. THERE MAY BE MEMORY CORRUPTION.

### You should have written this instead:

```c++
#include <xtd/xtd>

std::unique_ptr<xtd::forms::label> add_label(xtd::forms::form& f) {
  auto my_label = std::make_unique<xtd::forms::label>();
  my_label->text("Hello, World!");

  f.controls().push_back(*my_label);
  return my_label;
}

int main() {
  xtd::forms::form main_form;
  auto my_label = add_label(main_form);
  
  xtd::forms::application::run(main_form);
}
```
