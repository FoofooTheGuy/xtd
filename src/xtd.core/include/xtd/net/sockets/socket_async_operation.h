      /// @remarks This type describes the asynchronous socket operation that was most recently completed using a xtd::net::sockets::socket_async_event_args object. The value of the xtd::net::sockets::socket_async_event_args::last_operation property is set to xtd::net::sockets::socket_async_operation::none until the xtd::net::sockets::socket_async_event_args instance is used to begin an asynchronous socket operation. The property will then be set to the type of asynchronous operation being performed. This type more easily facilitates using a single completion callback delegate for multiple kinds of asynchronous socket operations. This type is intended for use in the socket_async_callback completion routine.
