    /// @remarks A key_press_event_args specifies the character that is composed when the user presses a key. For example, when the user presses SHIFT + K, the key_char property returns an uppercase K.
    /// @remarks A key_press event occurs when the user presses a key. Two events that are closely related to the key_press event are key_up and key_down. The key_down event precedes each key_press event when the user presses a key, and a key_up event occurs when the user releases a key. When the user holds down a key, duplicate key_down and key_press events occur each time the character repeats. One key_up event is generated upon release.
    /// @remarks With each key_press event, a key_press_event_args is passed. A key_event_args is passed with each key_down and key_up event. A key_event_args specifies whether any modifier keys (CMD, CTRL, SHIFT, or ALT) were pressed along with another key. (This modifier information can also be obtained through the modifier_keys property of the control class.)
    /// @remarks Set handled to true to cancel the key_press event. This keeps the control from processing the key press.
    /// @note Some controls will process certain key strokes on key_down. For example, rich_text_box processes the Enter key before key_press is called. In such cases, you cannot cancel the key_press event, and must cancel the key stroke from key_down instead.
