    /// @remarks A numeric_up_down control contains a single numeric value that can be incremented or decremented by clicking the up or down buttons of the control. The user can also enter in a value, unless the read_only property is set to true.
    /// @remarks The numeric display can be formatted by setting the decimal_places, hexadecimal, or thousands_separator properties. To display hexadecimal values in the control, set the hexadecimal property to true. To display a thousands separator in decimal numbers when appropriate, set the thousands_separator property to true. To specify the number of digits displayed after the decimal symbol, set the decimal_places property to the number of decimal places to display.
    /// @remarks To specify the allowable range of values for the control, set the minimum and maximum properties. Set the increment value to specify the value to be incremented or decremented to the value property when the user clicks the up or down arrow buttons. You can increase the speed that the control moves through numbers when the user continuously presses the up or down arrow by setting the accelerations property.
    /// @remarks When the up_button or down_button methods are called, either in code or by the click of the up or down buttons, the new value is validated and the control is updated with the new value in the appropriate format. Specifically, if the user_edit property is set to true, the parse_edit_text method is called prior to validating or updating the value. The value is then verified to be between the minimum and maximum values, and the update_edit_text method is called.
