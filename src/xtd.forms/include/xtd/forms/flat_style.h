    /// @remarks In the case of the popup style button, this enumeration controls some behavior as well as appearance. The popup style control initially appears flat until the mouse pointer moves over it. When the mouse pointer moves over the popup control, it appears as a standard style control until the mouse pointer is moved off of it again.
    /// @remarks If the system style is used, the appearance of the control is determined by the user's operating system and the following property values will be ignored: control_background_image, image_align, image, image_index, image_list, and text_align. In addition, the control.back_color property will be ignored for button controls. If supported, users can change the appearance of controls by adjusting the appearance settings of their operating system.
